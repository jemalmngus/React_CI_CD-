# My Custom Webpack React Project

This is a custom Webpack setup for a React project that allows you to have full control over the build configuration. It includes all the necessary configurations to develop, build, and deploy your React application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:


- `src/`: Contains all the React components and application logic.
- `public/`: Includes the `index.html` file and other static assets that will be served by the development server or used in the production build.
- `webpack.config.js`: The custom Webpack configuration file where you can customize the build process and add loaders, plugins, etc.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts to run development and build commands.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by version control.
- `Dockerfile`: Contains the configuration to create a Docker image for your React application.
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: The GitLab CI/CD configuration file for automating the build and deployment process.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

3. **Development Server**: To start the development server, run `npm start`. This will launch the application in your default web browser, and it will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.

4. **Build**: When you are ready to build the application for production, run `npm run build`. This will create an optimized bundle in the `bundle/` folder.

5. **Docker Image**: To create a Docker image for your application, run `docker build -t my-react-app .` in the project root. This will create a Docker image named `my-react-app`.

6. **Run the Docker Container**: Once the Docker image is created, you can run the container using `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app`. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

7. **Deploy with GitLab CI/CD**: The GitLab CI/CD configuration file `.gitlab-ci.yml` is set up to automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to the `master` branch. Simply configure your GitLab repository with the appropriate environment variables and Docker Registry settings to enable seamless CI/CD.

## Customizing Webpack

If you need to customize the Webpack configuration, open the `webpack.config.js` file. Here, you can add or modify loaders, plugins, and other settings to suit your project's requirements.

## Additional Features

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: This project is set up to support HMR for faster development without the need to manually reload the page.

- **CSS and SASS Support**: Easily include and style your CSS or SASS files with the provided loaders.

- **Image Optimization**: The Webpack configuration includes image optimization to minimize the size of your images.
